# Users

## Identity checks

The user should provide a screenshot containing the chat with their driver's license (/sdl to themselves) and a timestamp (/timestamp), and their character's face.
Driver's license is required to guarantee the character's age.
Face is required to have a visual identification, like any other identification document.
Timestamp is to mitigate the use of old screenshots like, for example, of a dead character.
Approve if *all* three are present in the same screenshot.
Reject and provide a reason if one or more is missing.
