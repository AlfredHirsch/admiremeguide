## Identity checks

The user should provide a screenshot containing the chat with their driver's license (/sdl to themselves) and a timestamp (/timestamp), and their character's face.
Driver's license is required to guarantee the character's age.
Face is required to have a visual identification, like any other identification document.
Timestamp is to mitigate the use of old screenshots like, for example, of a dead character.
Approve if *all* three are present in the same screenshot.
Reject and provide a reason if one or more is missing.

### Examples

(ref:bro) Example of a **correct** identity check, note the presence of a timestamp, the driver's license and the character face. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="(ref:bro)"}

```


(ref:foo) Example of a **wrong** identity check, note the lack of a timestamp. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="(ref:foo)"}
