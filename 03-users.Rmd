The user should provide a screenshot containing the chat with their driver's license (/sdl to themselves) and a timestamp (/timestamp), and their character's face.  
Driver's license is required to guarantee the character's age.  
Face is required to have a visual identification, like any other identification document.  
Timestamp is to mitigate the use of old screenshots like, for example, of a dead character.  
  
Approve if **all** three are present in the same screenshot.  
Reject and provide a reason if one or more is missing.


> _**NOTE**_: You should not repeatedly deny identity checks from the same person unless they keep submitting fake information. It can result in a ban.  
If a person keeps submitting the wrong information, but it looks like it is in good faith (as a rule of thumb, two to three attempts), flag it to management.
