## Tickets support

Tickets are raised for any kind of support a person might need in regard to the website. 
Tickets can be of Discord Roles, requested on the #roles channel, or Support, requested on the #support channel.  Support tickets can be of General meaning or a priority speed request for payments or verifications, as seen below. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="150%", fig.cap=" ", fig.align='center'}

```


When a ticket is opened by someone, it will show up in the ''TICKETS'' tab.  
Only moderators, management, GTAW management, and the person that opened the ticket have access to the specific channel opened by the ticket.  
In the image below, we can see there are two tickets to be handled (ticket-28 and ticket-29). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="150%", fig.cap=" ", fig.align='center'}

```

Inside it, one can see the reason for the ticket (1), in this example, a Request of Verification. 
One can also see the commands (2). If you want to handle the ticket yourself, click on ''Claim'' and proceed with the support.  
After the ticket is handled, it can be closed by clicking on the ''Close'' or ''Close With Reason'' buttons. 
The user that requested the ticket can include additional information on the channel as needed.  
In general, for now, Moderators are able to handle verification requests and Discord Roles. All others depend on the specific request. 


## Discord Roles

Two main roles are given by moderators: Client and Model.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="150%", fig.cap=" ", fig.align='center'}

```

Every information is provided by the ticket.

* Open the AdmireMe URL and check if the profile is verified.
  + If it's not, ask the user to request it [here](https://admireme.world/my/settings/verify).
  + If it is, hand the Model role on discord.As seen below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.show='hold'}

knitr::include_graphics(c("https://i.imgur.com/pl6frwF.png", "https://i.imgur.com/M5Zus24.png"))
```

* If it is the Client role, it doesn't need to be scrutinized like that.
