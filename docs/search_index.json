Use it as a guide or a place to look at when in doubt. It will take the approach of covering each tab the Moderator has access to. You can select a specific chapter in the sidebar on the left. The Admin Panel can be opened here. Try to solve your questions with this guide. Contact other moderators if needed, and contact Executives if really needed.

Driver’s license is required to guarantee the character’s age. Face is required to have a visual identification, like any other identification document. Timestamp is to mitigate the use of old screenshots like, for example, of a dead character. Approve if all three are present in the same screenshot. Reject and provide a reason if one or more is missing. 3.1.1 Examples Figure 3.1: Example of a correct identity check, note the presence of a timestamp, a driver’s license and the character face. Figure 3.2: Example of a wrong identity check, note the lack of a timestamp. Figure 3.3: Example of a wrong identity check, note the lack of a timestamp and the character’s face. Figure 3.4: Example of a wrong identity check, note the lack of a timestamp and the character’s face being on a different image.

Check every transaction carefully. You should access the Business Banking Account here to determine if the value claimed by the request was indeed deposited. This needs to be done every time, for every request. NOTE: Make sure the value the customer defined in the ‘’Amount’’ section of the request is the same amount present in the proof of payment/Bank Account logs. 4.3.1 Examples Figure 4.1: Example of a transaction that should be approved. Note that #, amount, and date are the same on the proof of payment and on the Business Bank.
