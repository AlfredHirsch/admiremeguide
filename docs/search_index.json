Use it as a guide or a place to look at when in doubt. It will take the approach of covering each tab the Moderator has access to. You can select a specific chapter in the sidebar on the left. The Admin Panel can be opened here. Try to solve your questions with this guide. Contact other moderators if needed, and contact Management if really needed.

Driver’s license is required to guarantee the character’s age. Face is required to have a visual identification, like any other identification document. Timestamp is to mitigate the use of old screenshots like, for example, of a dead character. Approve if all three are present in the same screenshot. Reject and provide a reason if one or more is missing. NOTE: You should not repeatedly deny identity checks from the same person unless they keep submitting fake information. It can result in a ban. If a person keeps submitting the wrong information, but it looks like it is in good faith (as a rule of thumb, two to three attempts), flag it to management. 3.1.1 Examples Figure 3.1: Example of a correct identity check, note the presence of a timestamp, a driver’s license and the character face. Figure 3.2: Example of a wrong identity check, note the lack of a timestamp. Figure 3.3: Example of a wrong identity check, note the lack of a timestamp and the character’s face.

There’s no hands-on work here. It can be needed to trace specific transactions that are being investigated for any reason, check bugs, or detect suspicious activity (someone instantly transferring all their money to another person, for example).

"],["payment-requests.html", "4.3 Payment Requests", " 4.3 Payment Requests This is one of the most important tasks of the Moderation Team. Give it a look often to see if there are new ones. Check every transaction carefully. You should access the Business Banking Account here to determine if the value claimed by the request was indeed deposited. This needs to be done every time, for every request. NOTE: Make sure the value the customer defined in the ‘’Amount’’ section of the request is the same amount present in the proof of payment/Bank Account logs. NOTE: Currently, moderators can’t check the Bank Logs. Process should be similar, with the exception of checking the logs themselves. Take the measures described below and above: * Check dates. * Check payment history of the User Id, make sure it is not a repeated screenshot. * Make sure the proof of payment contains every needed information: routing, amount, destination and that it is a confirmed transaction. * Check if amount requested is the same as the one shown in the proof of payment. * If in doubt, reject it and flag it to other mods/managment. NOTE: Currently, the deposit limit for the platform is 500.000. If for some reason, someone deposits more than that, they would submit two requests with the amount split on each one. This is not wrong and should be approved, with the appropriate checks. Moderators should take a look at the previous payment request history of the user. This can be done by in the Payment Requests window, searching for the User Id on the search bar. This can allow you to quickly check previous requests, find that this person was related to fraud or denied requests before, and check if the screenshot used as proof was already used before. Some things are suspicious by nature and deserve a better look, for example: Proof of payment is not from the same day, perform a search to see if it was used before. Transactions coming from accounts mentioned in #｜ic-emails or #｜ic-banned-users. 4.3.1 Examples Figure 4.1: Example of a transaction that should be approved. Note that #, amount, and date are the same on the proof of payment and on the Business Bank.

Tickets can be of Discord Roles, requested on the #roles channel, or Support, requested on the #support channel. Support tickets can be of General meaning or a priority speed request for payments or verifications, as seen below. When a ticket is opened by someone, it will show up in the ‘’TICKETS’’ tab. Only moderators, management, GTAW management, and the person that opened the ticket have access to the specific channel opened by the ticket. In the image below, we can see there are two tickets to be handled (ticket-28 and ticket-29). Inside it, one can see the reason for the ticket (1), in this example, a Request of Verification. One can also see the commands (2). If you want to handle the ticket yourself, click on ‘’Claim’’ and proceed with the support. After the ticket is handled, it can be closed by clicking on the ‘’Close’’ or ‘’Close With Reason’’ buttons. The user that requested the ticket can include additional information on the channel as needed. In general, for now, Moderators are able to handle verification requests and Discord Roles. All others depend on the specific request. "],["discord-roles.html", "5.2 Discord Roles", " 5.2 Discord Roles Two main roles are given by moderators: Client and Model. Every information is provided by the ticket. Open the AdmireMe URL and check if the profile is verified. If it’s not, ask the user to request it here. If it is, hand the Model role on discord.As seen below: If it is the Client role, it doesn’t need to be scrutinized like that.
