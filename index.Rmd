# Introduction

This document was created with the objective of having a proper written place for moderators to consult when performing their jobs.
Use it as a guide or a place to look at when in doubt.
It will take the approach of covering each tab the Moderator has access to. You can select a specific chapter in the sidebar on the left.

The Admin Panel can be opened [here](https://admireme.world/admin). 

Try to solve your questions with this guide. Contact other moderators if needed, and contact Executives if really needed.
